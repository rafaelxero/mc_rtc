# First example, we simplify task entries for the sake of the example
Example1:
  base: MetaTasks
  tasks:
     t1:
       objectiveA: 0.5
       objectiveB: 1.0
       completion:
         timeout: 5.0
# In Example1, one task is added and it will run for 5 seconds
# Second example
Example2:
  base: Example1
  tasks:
    t1:
      objectiveA: 1.0
      completion:
        eval: 1e-6
    t2:
      objective: 0.5
# Example2 has two tasks, and:
# - t1's objectiveA is changed to 1.0, objectiveB is the same
# - t1 completion criteria is replaced
# Third example
Example3:
  base: Example2
  tasks:
    t1:
      completion: null
    t2:
      completion:
        eval: 1e-6
# Example3 still have two tasks, objectives are unchanged but:
# - t1 has no more completion criteria
# - t2 has a completion criteria
