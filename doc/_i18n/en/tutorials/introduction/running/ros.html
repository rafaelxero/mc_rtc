<h4>Pre-requisites</h4>

<p>To run a controller in ROS using mc_rtc_ticker you need to have build mc_rtc with ROS support. You will also need {% link mc_rtc_ros %}.</p>

<p>We assume <span class="text-monospace">roscore</span> is already running or that <span class="text-monospace">ROS_MASTER_URI</span> points to an active master.</p>

<h4>Runing the display interface</h4>

<p>Run the following command to start RViZ along with mc_rtc dedicated panel and the robot model you need:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ roslaunch mc_rtc_ticker display.launch
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If your simulation has more than two robots, you should add a new RobotModel to the scene. The description of the robot is published in the parameter <code>/control/env_N</code> where N is the robot index.</p>

<h4>Running the controller</h4>

<p>To run the controller, use the following command:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ rosrun mc_rtc_ticker mc_rtc_ticker
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note that you can restart the controller without restarting the display interface.</p>
