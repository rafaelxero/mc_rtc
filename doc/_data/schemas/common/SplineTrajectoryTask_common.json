Contrary to most tasks, the stiffness here is expected to be high, as the trajectory task will track small errors. It is not uncommon to use a stiffness of 1000 or more if tracking accuracy is important.<br/><b>Warning:</b> Be careful to avoid discontinuities in the trajectory (e.g while manipulating the targets from the GUI), as the high tracking stiffness could generate fast motions."},
